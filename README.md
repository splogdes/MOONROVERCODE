# MOONROVERCODE

For this Project, it was required that a rover was built with an array of sensors to categorize rocks, that needed to be controlled from a website. I was responsible for building the website and code for the sensors, which can be found in `/Website`. The code in `/ROVER CODE/src/main.cpp`  is the source for the rover, which would host a webserver and then the user would connect to that IP address and then the website would be sent to the user who can then control the rover.
