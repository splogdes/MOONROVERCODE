# MOONROVERCODE

For this Project it was required that a rover was built with an array of sensors, that all needed to be controlled from a website. I was responsible for building the website and code for the sensors. Which can be found in `/Website` and the code in `/ROVER CODE/src/main.cpp` this is the code for all the sensors and sending the webpage to the user and based on the results from the sensors would work out which rock it was supposed to be.
